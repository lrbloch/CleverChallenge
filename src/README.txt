BONUS CHALLENGE:

When you expand the scope of this problem beyond one-room schoolhouses, 
you get a lot more entities that can interact in different ways. In the real Clever data model, 
there are teachers, sections, students, and apps, but also schools, districts, district 
administrators, student emergency contacts, and app developers.

With each entity comes a set of rules about what other entities they can see, 
as well as what entities they have the power to grant other entities access to. 
As the number of entities grows, the relationships become increasingly complex to compute.

How well would your design scale to hundreds of thousands of students? Would you need to 
make any changes? Or perhaps take a new approach?

How easy would it be to add new kinds of entities? What about adding or changing rules?
